Install ssh package on ubuntu:
   sudo apt-get install openssh-server
To start the service:
   sudo service ssh start
Configuration file location:
    /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Default port of ssh 22 if we want to change port no. of ssh service then we can change in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
after that we will start the service
Syntax for login:
ssh with password:
    ssh username@IP
ssh with key:
    ssh -i keyname username@IP

ssh login when port is different:
 ssh -i keyname username@ip -p portnumber

SSH Security:
   AllowUsers   ubuntu, root
   DenyUsers    kali, test

Secure copy (scp):
when i am source:
   scp -i keyname sourcefilelocation username@ip:/destinationlocation
when i am destination:
   scp -i keyname  username@ip:/sourcefilelocation   /home/jaya/destinationlocation
when i am nor a source and neither a destination:
   scp username@ip:/source username@ip:/destination

SCP command when ssh port no. is different:

scp -i keyname source -P portnumber username@ip

SFTP: secure file transfer protocol
    sftp -i keyname username@ip
       get for download
       put for upload

How to generate ssh key:

   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
   t for type
   b for bit
 
 it will generate two file 
 1. id_rsa   (private key)
 2. id_rsa.pub (public key)

rename id_rsa.pub to authorized_keys with below command
  mv id_rsa.pub  authorized_keys
 we will put public key in ~/.ssh folder 
private key will be shared with client to login on ssh server

to enable/disable password authentication in ssh:

  go to /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
please uncomment the below line
# PasswordAuthentication yes/no
we will remove # from below line and "no" for disable and "yes" for enable the password authentication
after that restart the service


Common Errors in SSH connection:

1. connection timeout:
    cause:
           security group (ip block)
           iptables (ip block)
2.  connection refused:
     cause: 
           if port is open That means service is stopped
3.  permission denied publickey:
      cause:
          private key not matching with publickey
          username may be wrong
          permission may be wrong
          DenyUsers enalbe 
4.  host not reachable:
      network not connected

NOTE: we can run more than one ssh service on a single server but port no. will be different and Configuration files 
also on different location
